# ArduPi

With ArduPi you can establish a i2c communication between a RaspberryPi and an Arduino in order to use the supported sensors connected to your Arduino directly on the Raspberry Pi.

The project is currently under development. Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/albertofanini/ardupi/wiki) for more informations.
